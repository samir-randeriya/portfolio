    "bio": "Four years ago, I wrote my first Laravel API endpoint that crashed spectacularly. Today, I architect backend systems that handle thousands of users without breaking a sweat. **The difference?** I learned that great software isn't just about writing code—it's about **solving real problems** for real people. I've spent **4+ years** turning chaotic requirements into **clean, scalable systems** that businesses actually depend on. What drives me? **That moment when a client says their platform finally handles the growth they've been chasing.** I don't just build features—I build the **reliable foundation** that lets startups scale and enterprises move faster. When I'm not deep in Laravel backends or architecting APIs, I'm learning what's next, because standing still isn't an option in this field.",
